## Why?

You would think that in this day and age, someone would have come up with a simple bulk downloader that actually works. I mean, come on! We've got self-driving cars, flying drones, and robots that can do backflips, but we can't figure out how to download a bunch of files without wanting to pull our hair out.

We have bulk managers that crash every five minutes, browser extensions that promise the world and then ask you to download 100 files separately, and software that's so bloated it makes your computer feel like it's running in quicksand.

For some reason nobody has a simple bulk downloader that actually works. A simple single HTML page. That's all that it takes.
